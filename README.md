# SDKCode

**InApp Integration Task:**
Using the INVIDI sample app in the github repo (1st link in resources below), follow the README file for
instructions on how to build it, then proceed to make the necessary code changes to setup the integration to
show pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll ads using the Pulse Android SDK. Make your project available in a git
repository to us and provide a comprehensive README. Also provide us with the debug build of the application.



- Downloaded the SDK Code.
- Modified the code and loaded the PreRoll, MidRoll and PostRoll ads.
- Midroll will be loaded at 10th Second.
- SDK is very cool, It's very clear code and major interesting points to note or learn for Displaying the ads are the VideoActivityPlayer, PulseManager and
values such as MidRollPosition, ContentUrl, DataTags etc.. It was very Interesting to Integrate the SDk. 


**HTML5 Integration Task:**
Create a web page containing a video player (use the native video element) which plays the video content
mentioned in the resources. Create an integration to show pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll ads using the Pulse
HTML5 SDK (with or without the ad player). Make your project available in a git repository to us and provide a
comprehensive README for us to run the project locally.

- Provided a HTML file and JS File
- If we double click on the HTML file, PreRoll, MidRoll and PostRoll ads will be loaded in the same Video
- MidRoll will be loaded at 10th Second.
- This was very Interesting Integration.


Thanks!
